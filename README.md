# Quick Job Finder

## Description

Remote Job Finder is a user-friendly web app that helps users search for remote job listings using the [Remotive API](https://remotive.io/api-documentation). Users can enter keywords and filter jobs by category like Software Development, Marketing, or Sales. The app runs inside Docker containers, with HAProxy acting as a load balancer to share traffic between two instances, ensuring better reliability and performance.

---

## Features

- Search remote jobs by keyword
- Filter job results by category
- View important job details like title, company, location, and application link
- Load balancing across two app instances with HAProxy for improved availability and scalability

---

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- External API: Remotive API
- Containerization: Docker
- Load balancing: HAProxy

---

## Lab Setup for Deploymet

This project uses a lab environment with three containers simulating two web servers and one load balancer:

- Web01 and Web02 run the application instances.
- Lb01 runs HAProxy, distributing incoming traffic between the two web servers.

This setup is based on the [web_infra_lab](https://github.com/waka-man/web_infra_lab) repository, which provides the Docker Compose configuration and network setup to easily deploy and test your app with load balancing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your local machine
- Docker Hub account (optional, for pulling the image)

### Running Locally

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. Build the Docker image for the application:

```bash
docker build -t kbelyse/wi-job-finder:v1 .
```

3. Run two containers on different ports to simulate multiple instances:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8081:80 kbelyse/wi-job-finder:v1
docker run -d -p 8082:80 kbelyse/wi-job-finder:v1
```

4. Build and run the HAProxy container which will act as the load balancer:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.haproxy -t my-haproxy .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-haproxy
```

5. Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You can refresh the page multiple times to see HAProxy distribute requests between the two backend containers.

## Load Balancer Configuration

The HAProxy backend is configured as follows in `haproxy.cfg`:

```haproxy
backend http_back
    balance roundrobin
    server web1 172.17.0.1:8081 check
    server web2 172.17.0.1:8082 check
```

**Note:**  
`172.17.0.1` is the Docker host IP inside the default Docker network on Linux.  
On Windows and Mac, `host.docker.internal` can be used instead, but this hostname does not resolve on Linux, so we use the IP address.

---

## Docker Hub Repository

The Docker image for this project is publicly available at:

[https://hub.docker.com/r/kbelyse/wi-job-finder](https://hub.docker.com/r/kbelyse/wi-job-finder)

You can pull the image using:

```bash
docker pull kbelyse/wi-job-finder:v1
```

---

## Challenges Encountered

- **HAProxy hostname resolution:** On Linux, `host.docker.internal` doesn't resolve by default, so I used the Docker bridge IP `172.17.0.1` for backend servers.
- **Port conflicts:** Managing multiple containers and ports required careful planning to avoid binding conflicts.
- **API rate limits and CORS:** Understanding the Remotive APIâ€™s limitations and testing via browser required handling CORS and fetching data securely.
